                Quantum mechanics is the science of the very small. It explains the
                behavior of matter and its interactions with energy on the scale of
                atoms and subatomic particles.

                By contrast, classical physics only explains matter and energy on a
                scale familiar to human experience, including the behavior of
                astronomical bodies such as the Moon. Classical physics is still
                used in much of modern science and technology. However, towards the
                end of the 19th century, scientists discovered phenomena in both the
                large (macro) and the small (micro) worlds that classical physics
                could not explain.[1] Coming to terms with these limitations led to
                two major revolutions in physics which created a shift in the
                original scientific paradigm: the theory of relativity and the
                development of quantum mechanics.[2] This article describes how
                physicists discovered the limitations of classical physics and
                developed the main concepts of the quantum theory that replaced it
                in the early decades of the 20th century. These concepts are
                described in roughly the order in which they were first discovered.
                For a more complete history of the subject, see History of quantum
                mechanics.

                Light behaves in some respects like particles and in other respects
                like waves. Matter—the "stuff" of the universe consisting of
                particles such as electrons and atoms—exhibits wavelike behavior
                too. Some light sources, including neon lights, give off only
                certain frequencies of light. Quantum mechanics shows that light,
                along with all other forms of electromagnetic radiation, comes in
                discrete units, called photons, and predicts its energies, colors,
                and spectral intensities. A single photon is a quantum, or smallest
                observable amount, of the electromagnetic field because a partial
                photon has never been observed. More broadly, quantum mechanics
                shows that many quantities, such as angular momentum, that appeared
                to be continuous in the zoomed-out view of classical mechanics, turn
                out to be (at the small, zoomed-in scale of quantum mechanics)
                quantized. Angular momentum is required to take on one of a set of
                discrete allowable values, and since the gap between these values is
                so minute, the discontinuity is only apparent at the atomic level.

                Many aspects of quantum mechanics are counterintuitive[3] and can
                seem paradoxical, because they describe behavior quite different
                from that seen at larger length scales. In the words of quantum
                physicist Richard Feynman, quantum mechanics deals with "nature as
                She is – absurd".[4] For example, the uncertainty principle of
                quantum mechanics means that the more closely one pins down one
                measurement (such as the position of a particle), the less accurate
                another measurement pertaining to the same particle (such as its
                momentum) must become.
